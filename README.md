# slurm_utilization

**N.B. all this is currently ad hoc**

Compute utilization by reading sreport usage and normalizing against total available SUs.

Data used is generated by the script `generate_sacct_reports.py`, which must be run as 
root in order to get `sacct` reports for all Slurm accounts.

Use the script: `utilization_from_sacct.py`
